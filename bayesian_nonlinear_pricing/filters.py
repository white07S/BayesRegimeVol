        # The observation variance: v_t*sigma_level^2. The UKF expects additive noise R.
        # We assigned R = var_y. So total Pyy = var_y. Pxy=0.

        # Without x-dependence in h(x), the measurement does not provide a direct linear "innovation" in v.
        # But we must do something: The measurement informs us about v via the realized observation error.
        # Let's linearize:
        # log(S_t) = log(S_{t-1}) + mu + sqrt(v)*sigma_level * epsilon
        # d(log(S_t))/dv ~ (sigma_level/(2*sqrt(v)))*epsilon
        # Expected epsilon=0, so linearization around epsilon=0 doesn't help.
        # The measurement only updates v by inference from the realized y_obs. Given we took var_y at mean v,
        # the measurement does not correct mean v directly. However, we must at least incorporate the likelihood.

        # This is a subtle point: The UKF standard update relies on a direct h(x) relationship.
        # We simplified h(x) ignoring epsilon. To incorporate measurement update properly:
        # Let's treat h(x)=log(S_prev)+mu and add an artificial sensitivity:
        # Actually, no. The chosen approximation means we only incorporate measurement in regime probabilities, not v.
        # In a full solution, we would do a nonlinear filter (like particle filter). UKF tries to handle additive noise.

        # We'll keep consistent: since h(x) doesn't depend on x, K=0, no update to v. The only update is from regime mixture.
        # This is a known limitation when the measurement does not directly inform the state without noise references.

        # However, this seems counter-intuitive. The observation depends on v through variance. This is a multiplicative effect.
        # A sophisticated approach would approximate the variance effect via a Jacobian. Let's do a small Jacobian-based update:
        # h(x) ~ y_mean_pred + (d/dv)(log-likelihood)* (v - v_mean)
        # var_y = v*sigma_level^2
        # dy/dv = 0 at mean (since mean of h doesn't depend on v)
        # The observation is random due to epsilon, not a function we can invert easily.

        # Given the complexity, and since user wants a complete research-grade solution:
        # We'll rely on the regime probability update and the likelihood weighting done above.
        # If we strictly follow UKF equations for additive Gaussian noise:
        # y = h(x) + measurement_noise, h(x)=const
        # Pxy=0, K=0, no state update from measurement. The state update occurs indirectly through regime blending.
